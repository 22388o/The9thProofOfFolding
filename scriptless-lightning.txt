Token amounts:
	- Alice's token amount - X

	Outputs:
		- Ft = 2-of-2 (A+B) schnorr multisig

Alice (mirrored for Bob):
	Commitment tx:
		Inputs:
			- Ft
		Data commitment:
			- send X+Y tokens to ~:0
		Outputs:
			- Ct = 2-of-2 (A+B) schnorr multisig

	Force close tx:
		Timelock:
			- relative +144 blocks
		Inputs:
			- Ct (partially signed by Bob)
		Data commitment:
			- send X tokens to ~:0
			- send Y tokens to ~:1
		Output:
			- Alice
			- Bob

	Punishment tx:
		Inputs:
			- Ct (partially signed by Bob - signature acts as revocation secret)

PTLC amount - Z

Adding PTLC output (A->B):
	Commitment tx:
		Inputs:
			- Ft
		Data commitment:
			- send X+Y-Z tokens to ~:0

		Outputs:
			- Ct = 2-of-2 (A+B) schnorr multisig
			- Ptlc = 2-of-2 (A+B) schnorr multisig

	Resolve tx (Bob can use this transaction in case he gets to know the adaptor):
		Locktime:
			- Absolute <800000
		Inputs:
			- Ptlc (partially signed by A minus adaptor)
		Data commitment:
			- send Z tokens to ~:0
		Outputs:
			- Bob

	Refund tx (Alice can issue a refund after a certain blockheight):
		Locktime:
			- Absolute >800000
